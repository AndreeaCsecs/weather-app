# Reactive Weather

## Story

People Always Talk About The Weather... They are always checking the weather in native and web applications.

A simple weather app built using React would allow users to input a location and receive current weather data for that location, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The app uses HTTPS Requests to fetch data from api.weatherapi.com and integrates with third-party libraries like React-Bootstrap, to provide a clean and user-friendly interface.
